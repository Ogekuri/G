Read the project's source code to determine software behavior and main features.\n   - Ignore/exclude all files in .*/** from the project's source code analysis.\n3. List used components and libraries.\n4. Create a Markdown file with the requirements draft at [../../docs/requirements.md_DRAFT.md](../../docs/requirements.md_DRAFT.md).\n   - Write requirements, section titles, tables, and other content in italian.\n   - Follow [/.req/templates/requirements.md](/.req/templates/requirements.md) translated into italian.\n   - Describe every project requirement clearly, succinctly, and unambiguously.\n   - Use bullet lists and express each requirement using the verb 'shall'. Translate 'shall' to the nearest equivalent in italian.\n5. Re-read [../../docs/requirements.md](../../docs/requirements.md) and verify the project's source code satisfies the listed requirements.\n   - For each requirement, report `OK` if satisfied or `FAIL` if not.\n   - For every `FAIL`, provide evidence: file path(s), line numbers (when relevant), and a short explanation.\n6. Present results in a clear, structured format suitable for analytical processing (lists of findings, file paths, and concise evidence).\n"}
